# exercise 4.1.7 from unit 4
'''
Moshe and Aviva both worked on the same list of data. They both decided to calculate a histogram and display it as a chart.
However, as you can see in the following figures,
each of them chose to group the data in a different way.

They both submitted their charts to Eric. After examining them, Eric argued that the histograms did not match each other, and that 
they should recheck the charts they had created. After checking, Moshe found that there was indeed a
mistake in the diagram he prepared, and submitted a corrected diagram.
Please note: in this question the list of data from which the histograms were built is not given. All
we know is that the histograms of Moshe and Aviva refer to the same list.
